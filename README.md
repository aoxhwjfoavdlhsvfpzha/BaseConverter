# BaseConverter
Python tkinter Hex, Binary, and Decimal converter

I needed a converter for some RFID/NFC work, and all the converters I tried kinda sucked. I think this one sucks less, so hopefully you do too.
With any luck I'll improve it as I continue using it

Requirements:  
Tkinter  
Pyperclip  
KDE Version Requirements:  
xsel (apt package not python)


Currently Pyperclip causes my system to hang on Debian12 with KDE, so you can use the KDE version if you're having issues on a similar system. It should be pretty any-linux compatible, you just need to have xsel installed

Just found out the PM3 client has an awesome converter built in, so I'll probably use this significantly less often. [data num](https://siliconbased.us/pm3/ref/data-num-help.php)
